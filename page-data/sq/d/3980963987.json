Luke DuBois</a>.</p>\n<p>I study how technology can facilitate creative expression and open pathways for people to express themselves on their own terms. I am especially interested in accessible musical instruments and creative coding environments. I use a participatory design approach to research in which individuals and communities impacted are engaged at all stages from formulating a problem to designing and evaluating potential solutions.</p>\n<p>Prior to NYU, I received a BS/MS in Computer Science and a BM in Music Composition from CU Boulder. I performed in multiple new-music ensembles like the <a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/music/ensembles/blork-boulder-laptop-orchestra\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Boulder Laptop Orchestra (BLOrk)</a>, studied with <a href=\"http://shaunkane.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Shaun Kane</a>, <a href=\"https://spot.colorado.edu/~clayton/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Clayton Lewis</a>, and <a href=\"https://michaeltheodore.info\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Michael Theodore</a>, and lived in the <a href=\"https://cuengineeringhonors.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Engineering Honors Program</a>.</p>\n<p>I publish articles in places like ASSETS (Computers and Accessibility), NIME (New Interfaces for Musical Expression), and MOCO (Movement and Computing).
