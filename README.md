# My Personal Website
https://williepayne.com

## Overview
I tend to remake my website every couple years and built this page to learn how to use [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/home).

## Commands
To develop:
```shell
$ npm start
```

To build (before deploying):
```shell
$ npm run build
```

To deploy:
```shell
$ npm run deploy
```
