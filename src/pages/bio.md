I am a PhD Candidate in Music Technology at New York University. As of 2020, I am the research assistant for the NSF funded project [Dancing Across Boundaries (DAB!)](https://www.kayladesportes.com/project/dab/) and an Accessible Music Technology Fellow at [FMDG School](https://fmdgmusicschool.org). My mentors include [Amy Hurst](http://amyhurst.com), [Yoav Bergner](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/people/yoav-bergner), and [Kayla Desportes](https://www.kayladesportes.com).

In my research, I study how technology can open pathways for people to express themselves on their own terms and build confidence and self worth enacting original art. I am especially interested in accessible music instruments, creative coding environments, and how to carry out design processes with meaningful end-user participation.

Prior to NYU, I received a BS/MS in Computer Science and a BM in Music Composition from CU Boulder. I performed in multiple new-music ensembles like the [Boulder Laptop Orchestra (BLOrk)](https://www.colorado.edu/music/ensembles/blork-boulder-laptop-orchestra), studied with [Shaun Kane](http://shaunkane.com), [Clayton Lewis](https://spot.colorado.edu/~clayton/), and [Michael Theodore](https://michaeltheodore.info), and lived in the [Engineering Honors Program](https://cuengineeringhonors.com).

I publish articles in places like ASSETS (Computers and Accessibility), NIME (New Interfaces for Musical Expression), and MOCO (Movement and Computing). I have received numerous scholarships and awards including a [Best Paper Honorable Mention at CHI](https://programs.sigchi.org/chi/2021/program/content/47810), [Boettcher Scholarship](https://boettcherfoundation.org/colorado-scholarships/) (full-ride to any Colorado university), and the distinction of [Outstanding Graduate of Engineering at CU.](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/2016/12/07/cs-student-named-colleges-outstanding-graduate)
