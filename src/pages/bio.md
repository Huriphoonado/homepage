I am an [Assistant Professor of User Experience / Design at the UNC-Chapel Hill School of Information and Library Science (SILS)](https://sils.unc.edu/people/william-willie-payne/).

I study how technology can support creativity and open pathways for individuals to express themselves on their own terms. To this end, I use participatory methods. I work closely with collaborators throughout design and deploy novel systems in their environments. Some results:
* [FiLOrk](https://doi.org/10.1145/3635636.3656200) - Blind youth live coding electronic music!
* [danceON](https://doi.org/10.1145/3411764.3445149) - Teen girls making animations that respond to dance!
* [Cyclops](https://www.nime.org/proceedings/2020/nime2020_paper112.pdf) - Improvising music with eye input!

My articles are published mainly at HCI (Human Computer Interaction) conferences including ASSETS (Computers and Accessibility), Creativity & Cognition, and NIME (New Interfaces for Musical Expression).

I graduated in 2023 with a PhD in Music Technology at NYU where I was advised by [Amy Hurst](http://amyhurst.com), and mentored by [Yoav Bergner](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/people/yoav-bergner), [Kayla DesPortes](https://www.kayladesportes.com), and [R. Luke DuBois](https://www.lukedubois.com). Before that, I earned a BS/MS in Computer Science and a BM in Music Composition from CU Boulder, where I studied with [Shaun Kane](http://shaunkane.com), [Clayton Lewis](https://spot.colorado.edu/~clayton/), and [Michael Theodore](https://michaeltheodore.info).
