I am an [Assistant Professor of User Experience / Design at the UNC-Chapel Hill School of Information and Library Science (SILS)](https://sils.unc.edu/people/william-willie-payne/).

I study how technology can facilitate creative expression and open pathways for people to express themselves on their own terms. I build accessible musical instruments and creative coding environments. I use a participatory approach to research in which I work closely with end-users throughout a design process and situate interventions in authentic learning and art making environments.

I have published work at highly selective HCI conferences. I recently won [Best Technical Paper at Web4All '22](https://www.w4a.info/2022/?page_id=348) and [Best Paper Honorable Mention at CHI '21](https://programs.sigchi.org/chi/2021/program/content/47810). I  regularly co-author with undergraduate students. My [mentorship efforts received recognition at NYU](https://meet.nyu.edu/academics/music-technology-and-accessibility-a-vertically-integrated-project/), and my students won [3rd place at the NYU Engineering Research Expo](https://engineering.nyu.edu/research-innovation/student-research/research-excellence-exhibit).

I hold a PhD in Music Technology at NYU. From 2020â€“2023, I was the research assistant for [Dancing Across Boundaries (DAB!)](https://www.kayladesportes.com/project/dab/) and the Accessible Music Technology Fellow at [FMDG Music School](https://fmdgmusicschool.org). I was advised by [Amy Hurst](http://amyhurst.com), and mentored by [Yoav Bergner](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/people/yoav-bergner), [Kayla DesPortes](https://www.kayladesportes.com), and [R. Luke DuBois](https://www.lukedubois.com).

I also hold a BS/MS in Computer Science and a BM in Music Composition from CU Boulder. I attended CU on a [Boettcher Scholarship (full-ride to any Colorado university)](https://boettcherfoundation.org/colorado-scholarship) and was the [Outstanding Graduate of Engineering](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/2016/12/07/cs-student-named-colleges-outstanding-graduate). At CU I performed in new-music ensembles like the [Boulder Laptop Orchestra (BLOrk)](https://www.colorado.edu/music/ensembles/blork-boulder-laptop-orchestra), studied with [Shaun Kane](http://shaunkane.com), [Clayton Lewis](https://spot.colorado.edu/~clayton/), and [Michael Theodore](https://michaeltheodore.info), and lived in the [Engineering Honors Program](https://cuengineeringhonors.com).
