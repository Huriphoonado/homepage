I develop holistic, creative tools intended to help humans express themselves on their own terms and build confidence and self worth enacting original art.

Before beginning a PhD at NYU, I studied at CU Boulder (Computer Science (BS/MS) and Music Composition (BM)) and was the Outstanding Graduate of the College of Engineering.
