title: Dancing Across Boundaries!
---
I am the Research Assistant for the NSF funded-project [DAB!](https://www.kayladesportes.com/project/dab/) integrating data science, machine learning, and physical computing in the context of dance and cheerleading. As a component of this work, I am developing danceON, a web-based programming environment for describing animations that respond to body position and movement using a declarative syntax [video | demo].
