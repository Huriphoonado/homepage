I design musical interactions and interfaces that are accessible to a wide range of users with diverse abilities. I am especially interested in making music computing more accessible in collaboration with people with no vision or low vision. My team developed a screen-reader friendly prototype of a circular drum-machine [[video](https://youtu.be/mXTWnIrAsNQ) | [try](https://nyumusedlab.github.io/Accessible-Groove-Pizza/)].

I recently interned at the [Hands-Free Music Project](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/microsoft-hands-free-music/) at Microsoft Research. I also work as the Accessible Music Technology Fellow at the [Filomen M D'Agostino Greenberg (FMDG) Music School](https://fmdgmusicschool.org) where I transcribe sheet music to convert to braille/large print, and learn from educators who are experts at teaching blind and visually impaired musicians.
